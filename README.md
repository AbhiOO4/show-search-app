# A micro project created as a part of learning api requests using ajax.
It sends a get request using axios to the tv maze api that contains almost all of the tv shows, its response is obtained and implicitly parsed in json format
using axios library and used to obtain and display the image, name and rating info about the tv shows when searched. It also provides a small lesson in handling asynchronous tasks
which is handled here using a asyn fucntion and await keyword.
